# challenge of a REST API CHALLENGE movies

the challenge was resolved


A company that has a website about movies wants to provide its customers and users an API to
query their database, as well as provide the trusted company users the ability to update or
create new records.
In order to complete this, you must create a RESTful interface that will provide access to the
company’s database.

You can review
the code up to the course progress in the [releases section](https://github.com/pablotrinidad/cride-platzi/releases)

on how to get this project up and running locally.
If you don't want to do it, just run:

bash
sudo docker compose -f local.yml build
sudo docker-compose -f local.yml up
